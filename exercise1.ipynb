    "Let's take a brief look at how python uses protobuf definitions and protoc, the protobuf compiler, to send structured data between different services or applications in a language- and platform-neutral format. The data structures defined in the .proto file are compiled into python classes. Protobuf's library functions are then used to serialize and deserialize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the snip below we use the jupyter notebook magic command `%cd` to move to the `warm_up` directory and `!` to call a shell command in a new process (similar to `fork()` and `exec()`). Protoc creates a `.py` file used for the definition, serialization, and deserialization of protobuf-defined types."

    "## Part 2: Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "You are a systems engineer at Stellar Horizons, a cutting-edge space startup that specializes in interplanetary missions. Recently, your team successfully launched the Jupyter Probe to study the atmosphere of Jupiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "During routine operations, communication with Jupyter Probe was suddenly lost due to a power surge and system failure at the Ares Link Facility, which serves as the primary communication hub for the probe.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the lead systems engineer, your responsibility is to manage the crisis. The fate of the Jupyter Probe, a multi-million-dollar investment, hangs in the balance. Preliminary analysis suggests the last data transmission might contain clues about the probeâ€™s current status and trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.1: Data Analysis\n",
    "As part of your contingency operations, you access the pcapng (Packet Capture) file containing the last transmissions received from the Jupyter Probe. These transmissions are encoded using Protocol Buffers. However, the protobuf definition file was corrupted when the system went down. Your team is currently working to recover it but in the meantime you must parse out what information you can from the packet logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: open the file in Wireshark to determine the following:\n",
    "a. What transport protocol is the system using to send and receive messages?\n",
    "b. There are two port numbers being used, what are they? Which is the Ares Link ground station and which is the Jupyter Probe?\n",
    "c. How many message types do you see?\n",
    "d. Decode the first instance of each message type to get the following information about each field:\n",
    "\t1. Field number\n",
    "\t2. Field type\n",
    "\t3. Field value (decode varint and string types, leave floating point values as binary)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.2: Regaining Control\n",
    "In a fortunate turn of events, an intern at the facility has recovered a copy of the protobuf specification used for communications with Jupyter Probe (`specification.txt`). This document provides the names of the variables encoded in the transmissions, which will aid in correlating them with the data you've recovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flight dynamics team has reported that the initial data decoded from the pcapng file indicates that Jupyter Probe is currently in an unstable orbit around Mars. If immediate corrective actions are not taken, the probe could either escape Mars's orbit on a bad trajectory or crash into its surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must bootstrap a solution. As a minimum, the flight dynamics team has identified that sending a packet with correctly calculated **engine burn time** and **angle of thrust** floating point values should command the probe to correct its course. Thinking back to your time as an EEE466 student, you know it's possible to develop a python script that can interpret the incoming telemetry and send new flight commands to adjust back to a safe trajectory using protobuf marshalling. The flight dynamics team will provide you with the trajectory equation based on the current orbital parameters and the desired trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: Using the data you decoded from the packet logs and hints from the specification file, write a protobuf file that will allow you to interface with Jupyter Probe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4: Write a ground station python script to accept telemetry data from Jupyter Probe, perform the adjustment calculation, and transmit a control signal. Listen for new data to come back from the probe indicating that it has returned to a safe trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The desired velocity for a safe trajectory is x=3,y=1,z=0 km/s. The engineers at flight dynamics have represented this as an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "desired_velocity = np.array([3, 1, 0]) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use the same format after receiving the current velocity from Jupyter Probe.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're ready to test your solution, run `jupyter_probe.exe`. Show that you have completed the challenge by printing the velocity data and the message containing the secret word.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "Submit a zip archive in the format `eee446_ex1_lastname1_lastname2.zip` that includes the following:\n",
    "1. This `.ipynb` notebook with the answers to questions 1 and 2 appended as a new cell.\n",
    "2. Your proto file (question 3).\n",
    "3. Your ground station python file (question 4).\n",
